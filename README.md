This is a NSGA code based on pymoo to figure out the multi-objective optimizaiton problem in the modular construction manufacturing.
The output results are obtained from the simulation of five facility layout designs including the current layout (process layout), product layout, combination layout, fixed position layout, and cellular layout.
