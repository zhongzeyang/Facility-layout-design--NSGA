# Facility-layout-design--NSGA

The selection of the facility layout design is a complicated multi-objective optimization problem. 

Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm is a solid algorithm to handle this problem. 

The objective functions for the facility layout design are to maximize the output and minimize the cost.

The detailed codes for the simulation and optimization are in the batch NSGA.
